## General Implementation Guidelines

All games on GameKonnekt should follow these guidelines:

1. **Component Structure**: Create a React functional component with hooks for state management
2. **Game State Persistence**: Use the `useGameState` hook for saving/loading game state
3. **UI Components**: Use the existing UI component library (shadcn/ui)
4. **Animations**: Use Framer Motion for animations and transitions
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the game works well on both desktop and mobile devices
6. **Accessibility**: Include keyboard controls where appropriate and ensure good contrast
7. **Performance**: Optimize rendering and avoid unnecessary re-renders
8. **Code Organization**: Keep game logic separate from rendering logic

## Proposed Games

### Pac-Man
- **Complexity**: High
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Requires a grid-based game board with walls and paths
  - AI for ghost movement with different behaviors
  - Collision detection for pellets, power pellets, and ghosts
  - Animation for character movement and direction changes
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Use a 2D array to represent the maze
  - Implement A* pathfinding for ghost AI
  - Use CSS animations for character movement
  - Store high scores and level progression using the game state hook

### Chess
- **Complexity**: High
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Complex rule set with many piece types and movement patterns
  - Check and checkmate detection
  - Potential for AI opponent
  - Notation system for moves
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Use a chess library like chess.js for game logic
  - Implement drag-and-drop for piece movement
  - Add highlighting for valid moves
  - Include options for playing against AI or another player

### Hangman
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Word dictionary/API
  - Letter input handling
  - Game state tracking (guessed letters, remaining attempts)
  - Visual representation of the hangman
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Create a word list or use an API for random words
  - Use SVG for the hangman drawing
  - Implement keyboard input for letter selection
  - Add difficulty levels based on word length/complexity

### Connect Four
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Grid-based game board
  - Gravity simulation for dropping pieces
  - Win condition detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
  - Turn-based gameplay
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Use a 2D array for the game board
  - Implement animations for dropping pieces
  - Add win detection algorithms
  - Include options for playing against AI or another player

### Simon
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Sequence generation and tracking
  - Timing for displaying the sequence
  - User input validation
  - Audio feedback
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Use state to store and extend the sequence
  - Implement animations for button highlights
  - Add sound effects for each button
  - Include increasing difficulty with longer sequences and faster playback

### Pong
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Physics for ball movement and bouncing
  - Paddle control (keyboard/touch)
  - Collision detection
  - Score tracking
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
  - Implement simple physics for ball movement
  - Add keyboard and touch controls
  - Include options for single player (vs AI) or two players

### Crossword
- **Complexity**: High
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Puzzle generation or database
  - Grid layout with clues
  - Input handling for letters
  - Validation of completed puzzles
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Use pre-generated puzzles or an API
  - Implement a grid system for the crossword layout
  - Add navigation between cells (keyboard/mouse)
  - Include hint system and difficulty levels

### Mahjong Solitaire
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - 3D layout of tiles
  - Matching logic
  - Tile accessibility detection
  - Shuffle and hint systems
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Use CSS 3D transforms for the tile layout
  - Implement algorithms to determine which tiles are accessible
  - Add animations for tile removal
  - Include different layouts and difficulty levels

### Solitaire
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Card deck management
  - Drag-and-drop functionality
  - Rule enforcement for card placement
  - Undo/redo functionality
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Use a card library or create custom card components
  - Implement drag-and-drop for card movement
  - Add animations for dealing and moving cards
  - Include different solitaire variants (Klondike, Spider, etc.)

### Battleship
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Grid-based game boards for player and opponent
  - Ship placement logic
  - Turn-based gameplay
  - AI for single-player mode
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Use 2D arrays for game boards
  - Implement drag-and-drop for ship placement
  - Add animations for hits and misses
  - Include different AI difficulty levels

## Implementation Priorities

Based on complexity, popularity, and fit with the existing platform, here's a suggested order of implementation:

1. **Hangman** - Low complexity, high recognition, easy to implement
2. **Pong** - Medium complexity, iconic game, good starting point
3. **Connect Four** - Medium complexity, popular game, straightforward rules
4. **Simon** - Medium complexity, recognizable memory game
5. **Battleship** - Medium complexity, popular strategy game
6. **Solitaire** - Medium complexity, extremely popular card game
7. **Mahjong Solitaire** - Medium complexity, popular puzzle game
8. **Pac-Man** - High complexity, iconic arcade game
9. **Crossword** - High complexity, popular word game
10. **Chess** - High complexity, classic strategy game

Each game should be implemented one at a time, with thorough testing before moving on to the next game.
