## Implementation Priorities

Based on popularity, implementation complexity, and diversity of game categories, we recommend the following implementation order:

### High Priority (Easy Wins)
1. Hangman (Word game, low complexity)
2. Pong (Arcade classic, low complexity)
3. Simon (Memory game, low complexity)
4. Connect Four (Strategy game, low-medium complexity)

### Medium Priority (Popular but more complex)
1. Solitaire (Card game, very popular)
2. Pac-Man (Arcade classic, very popular)
3. Mahjong Solitaire (Puzzle game, popular)
4. Battleship (Strategy game, multiplayer potential)

### Lower Priority (More complex implementations)
1. Chess (Strategy game, complex rules and AI)
2. Crossword (Word game, requires content generation)

## Technical Considerations

When implementing these games, consider:

1. Mobile responsiveness - ensure games work well on touch devices
2. Accessibility features - add keyboard controls and screen reader support
3. Difficulty levels - where applicable, provide easy/medium/hard options
4. Multiplayer potential - some games like Chess, Connect Four, and Battleship could support multiplayer modes
5. High score tracking - implement local storage for tracking player progress

## Next Steps

1. Create component files for each new game in the `components/games` directory
2. Uncomment the imports and game entries in `app/page.tsx`
3. Implement games in order of priority
4. Test thoroughly on different devices and screen sizes
5. Add to the main GameKonnekt library
